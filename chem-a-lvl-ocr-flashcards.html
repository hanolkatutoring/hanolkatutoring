"4.1.2 Alkanes":
[
  {
    "q": "What type of bonds do alkanes contain?",
    "a": "Alkanes contain only single C–C and C–H bonds, which are sigma (σ) bonds formed by direct overlap of orbitals."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why can sigma bonds in alkanes freely rotate?",
    "a": "Because sigma bonds involve head-on overlap of orbitals directly between atoms, allowing free rotation without breaking the bond."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the shape and bond angle around each carbon atom in alkanes, and why?",
    "a": "Each carbon is tetrahedral with bond angles of approximately 109.5°, due to electron pair repulsion. 4 bond pairs repel."
  },
  {
    "q": "How does the boiling point of alkanes change with chain length and branching?",
    "a": "Boiling points increase with longer carbon chains due to more electrons so stronger London (induced dipole–dipole) forces; branching decreases boiling point by reducing surface area; fewer points of contact means weaker London forces."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why are alkanes generally unreactive with many reagents?",
    "a": "Because of the high bond enthalpy of C–C and C–H sigma bonds and their very low polarity, making them chemically stable."
  },
  {
    "q": "What are the products of complete combustion of alkanes and why is incomplete combustion dangerous?",
    "a": "Complete combustion produces CO2 and H2O. Incomplete combustion can produce carbon monoxide (CO), which is toxic as it binds irreversibly to haemoglobin."
  },
  {
    "q": "Describe the radical substitution mechanism of alkanes with chlorine or bromine under UV light.",
    "a": "It involves homolytic fission producing radicals (initiation), propagation steps where radicals react with alkanes forming new radicals and a product, and termination where radicals combine to end the chain reaction."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is homolytic fission in the context of alkane radical substitution?",
    "a": "Homolytic fission is the breaking of a covalent bond where each atom takes one electron, forming two radicals with unpaired electrons."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why is radical substitution limited in synthesis of specific products?",
